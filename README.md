An F5 IRules LX Workspace to add Netacea functionality to F5.

## üí° Getting Started
There are 2 ways to get started
### üéÇ Prebuilt Package
Download the latest package from the [releases](https://github.com/Netacea/f5-worker-template-typescript/releases) page.
Then see the [upload](https://github.com/Netacea/f5-worker-template-typescript/wiki/IRules-LX#upload-workspace) section of our wiki.

After uploading the workspace, under `Local Traffic > iRules > LX Workspaces` click on the `Netacea` LX Workspace. In `Workspace Files` there will be a netacea directory with a `NetaceaConfig.json` in there - place your `apiKey` and `secretKey` in respective places in this JSON file.

### üõ† DIY
Ensure the `@netacea/f5` package is up to date by running:
```bash
npm i @netacea/f5@latest
```
Insert your Netacea API and Secret key into `./src/NetaceaConfig.json`.

Then run
```bash
npm run build
```
This will create a GZipped workspace ready to [upload](https://github.com/Netacea/f5-worker-template-typescript/wiki/IRules-LX#upload-workspace
